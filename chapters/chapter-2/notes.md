## CHAPTER 2

### 2.1 Arithmetic Overview

- _integer representations_ can encode a small range of values precisely
    - _unsigned encodings_ are based on traditional binary notation
    - _two's complement_ encodings are used to represent signed integers
- _floating points_ can encode a wide range of values approximately
    - base-two version of scientific notation for real numbers
- _overflow_ can occur when results of arithmetic operations are too large
    - e.g. on a system w/ 32-bit ints, **200 * 300 * 400 * 500 = -884901888**
